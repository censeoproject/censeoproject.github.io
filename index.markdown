# NASA Hunch Project: Censeo Medical Inventory System

## Project Goal

Our goal is to design an inventory system that can be used to measure medical supplies on NASA missions.

This system is designed to be easy to learn and use.  It is quick compact and reliable.  Where possible, we have implemented automatic measurements and wireless data transmission.
