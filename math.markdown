# Calculating Medical Cream
## Problem:
Measuring quantities of cream in a low-gravity environment can be quite difficult. Obviously, you could keep track of them by the bottle, but what if you wanted a more precise measurement?
## Solution:
Calculate the volume of cream dispensed as a squeezer moves along the bottle.
# The Math Behind This
## Deriving a Formula for the Geometric Solid
The first step is to represent a tube of medical cream as a three-dimensional geometric solid. At one end, the bottle is a circle. At the other end, it is a flat line. This lead us to discover that a bottle of cream is essentially an ellipse whose height and width shift over the z-axis. The equation for an ellipse is shown below. The width and height of this ellipse are r\*a and r\*b, respectively.
