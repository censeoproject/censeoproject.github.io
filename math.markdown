# Calculating Medical Cream
## Problem:
Measuring quantities of cream in a low-gravity environment can be quite difficult. Obviously, you could keep track of them by the bottle, but what if you wanted a more precise measurement?
## Solution:
Calculate the volume of cream dispensed as a squeezer moves along the bottle.
# The Math Behind This
## Deriving a Formula for the Geometric Solid
The first step is to represent a tube of medical cream as a three-dimensional geometric solid. At one end, the bottle is a circle. At the other end, it is a flat line. This lead us to discover that a bottle of cream is essentially an ellipse whose height and width shift over the z-axis. The equation for an ellipse is shown below. The width and height of this ellipse are ra and rb, respectively.

*To make things easier going forward, the constants W, R, and L will represent the width of the flat end, the radius of the round end, and the length of the tube, respectively.*
If r is set to 1, then width and height are simply a and b. Using this, we can then swap out a and b with linear equations that represent the change in height or width as the position along the z-axis changes. This equation represents the geometric solid of a tube of medical cream.

Here is the graph of this equation after it has been solved for z, and arbitrary values have been entered for W, R, and L. As you can see, it clearly resembles a tube of toothpaste.
