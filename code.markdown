# Coding the Inventory System
## Basics
Our main inventory system is primarily written in Python and consists of 660 lines of code in the main file alone. The entire system consists of well over 1000 lines of code. The data is stored in a JSON file where it can be accessed and updated with ease. The system is designed to support automatic data transmission, as is demonstrated in our pill dispenser prototype.
## Stored Data
* The name and ID number of each supply
